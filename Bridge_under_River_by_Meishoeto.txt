BRIDGE UNDER RIVER 
by Limson G. K.

The echoes are still praying
And falling beyond silence
Those waves that's in mind
Still impact what I can see
No broken morning returns
With all my possible words
Here I lost and found myself
But how does sun set all the day

Up and down 
I walk on bridge
The bridge is under river
That seems to never exist at any time
Up and down 
I walk on bridge
The bridge is under river
That cannot be spoken at any time

Fairy tales come into dreams
Shabby streets is under my feet
Zigzag wind is tearing sight
When will air abuse destroy me
Continuous mist shares coldness
While I have to stand in fog
I'm the one who feel sleepy
But how does sun set all the day

Up and down 
I walk on bridge
The bridge is under river
That seems to never exist at any time
Up and down 
I walk on bridge
The bridge is under river
That cannot be spoken at any time

Up and down 
I walk on bridge
The bridge is under river
That seems to never exist at any time
Up and down 
I walk on bridge
The bridge is under river
That cannot be spoken at any time
